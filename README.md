# RedvsBlue

Worked on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst. 
As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable VM within the environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. 
As the Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during the first engagement. 
I used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for my report. 
Then, I interpreted the log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that I successfully performed.
